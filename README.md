A simple web-based TicTacToe game, created as a learning project. Includes an optional advanced mode for strategic gameplay.

## Features
- **Classic Mode**: Play the standard TicTacToe game with a friend.
- **Strategic Mode**: An optional feature that removes the first move of each player starting from the third round, making the game longer and more tactical.

- Implement a scoreboard to track wins and losses.
- Implement Responsive Design for mobile browsers.
